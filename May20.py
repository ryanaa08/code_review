 From a list of IP addresses, return the first index and the last index in the list. Also return the number of 
 available hosts in your network. 
 *** Networks can be chosen at random, or you can use the example network below ***
 Ex. 
['192.168.0.0', '192.168.0.1', '192.168.0.2', '192.168.0.3', '192.168.0.4', '192.168.0.5', '192.168.0.6', '192.168.0.7']
 
192.168.0.0
192.168.0.7

('192.169.0.0/27')
('192.169.0.32/27')
('192.169.0.64/27')
('192.169.0.96/27')
